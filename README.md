ðŸ¦– DINOSAURS ANALYSIS PROJECT USING DATA SCIENCE


OVERVIEW

This project explores the fascinating world of dinosaurs using data science techniques! By analyzing a dataset of 25 dinosaur species, we uncover trends in their size, weight, diet, and time periods. The project applies clustering, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand these incredible creatures that roamed the Earth millions of years ago.

FEATURES

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize dinosaur sizes, weights, and their relationships to diet and time periods.
Explore diet distributions across the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
Clustering:

Classify dinosaurs into clusters based on size (length) and weight using KMeans.
Visualizations:

Box plots for size analysis by diet.
Scatter plots to display clusters of dinosaurs by physical traits.
Count plots for diet distribution over different time periods.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Encoding categorical variables (Diet, Period, Habitat) into numerical formats for clustering.
Output Results:

Save processed data and analysis results into a CSV file for further exploration.



DATASET

The dataset consists of 25 dinosaur species with the following attributes:

Name: Species name.
Diet: Carnivore, Herbivore, or Omnivore.
Length (m): Dinosaur length in meters.
Weight (t): Dinosaur weight in tons.
Period: Time period when the dinosaur lived (Jurassic or Cretaceous).
Habitat: Land, Water, or Air.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS


Expand the dataset with more species and attributes (e.g., speed, lifespan, fossil location).
Perform predictive analysis (e.g., predicting weight from other features).
Integrate real-world datasets from sources like Kaggle or public repositories.
Use advanced machine learning techniques for classification and regression.
